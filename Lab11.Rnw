\cite{Kasdin25} show that dopamine in the brains of young zebra finches acts as 
a learning signal, increasing when they sing closer to their adult song and 
decreasing when they sing further away, effectively guiding their vocal 
development through trial-and-error. This suggests that complex natural 
behaviors, like learning to sing, are shaped by dopamine-driven reinforcement 
learning, similar to how artificial intelligence learns. You can find the 
paper at this link:
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08729-1}{{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08729-1}.}.

Note they measure dopamine using fibre photometry, changes in the fluorescence
indicate dopamine changes in realtime. Their specific measurement considers 
changes in flourescence in 100-ms windows between 200 and 300 ms from the start 
of singing, averaged across development.

% CONDUCT A POWER ANALYSIS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Using the \texttt{pwr} package for \texttt{R} \citep{pwr},
conduct a power analysis. How many observations would the researchers 
need to detect a moderate-to-large effect ($d=0.65$) when using 
$\alpha=0.05$ and default power (0.80) for a two-sided one sample 
$t$ test.
<<echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE>>=
library(pwr)
(power <- power.t.test(delta = 0.65, sig.level = 0.05,
             power = 0.8,
             type = "one.sample",
             alternative = "two.sided"))
@
The number of observations that the researchers need to detect a moderate-to-large effect of d = 0.65 is n = 20.58 which is around 21 observations. This was completed using the \texttt{pwr} package in \texttt{R} \citep{pwr}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% COLLECT DATA
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Click the link to go to the paper. Find the source data for 
Figure 2. Download the Excel file. Describe what you needed to
do to collect the data for Figure 2(g). Note that you only need the 
\texttt{closer\_vals} and \texttt{further\_vals}. Ensure to 
\texttt{mutate()} the data to get a difference 
(e.g., \texttt{closer\_vals - further\_vals}).
<<echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE>>=
dat.fig2g <- read_csv("fig2gdata.csv")
dat.fig2g <- dat.fig2g |>
  mutate(difference = closer_vals - further_vals)
@
I downloaded excel file called source data for Figure 2g and isolated the columns for the data needed to replicate Figure 2g. Those columns were closer\_vals and further\_vals. I computed a new variable called difference which quantifies the change in dopamine levels between the closer and farther values. Figure 2g is a scatter plot of averaged delta(F) / F signals for all syllables for closer (blue) and further (red) renditions \citep{Kasdin25}.

  \item \textbf{Optional Challenge:} Can you reproduce Figure 2(g)?
  Note that the you can use \texttt{geom\_errorbar()} to plot
  the range created by adding the mean $\pm$ one standard deviation.

% CONDUCT THE TESTS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Conduct the inferences they do in the paper. Make sure to report the results
a little more comprehensively -- that is your parenthetical should look something
like: ($t=23.99$, $p<0.0001$; $g=1.34$; 95\% CI: 4.43, 4.60).\\
\textbf{Note:} Your numbers may vary slightly as they performed some unclear
correction of their $p$-values. I'm waiting to hear back from them via email!
\begin{enumerate}
  \item ``The close responses differed significantly from 0 ($p=1.63 \times 10^{-8}$).''
  \item ``The far responses differed significantly from 0 ($p=5.17 \times 10^{-8}$).''
  \item ``The difference between populations was significant ($p=1.04 \times10^{-8}$).''
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% CONDUCT THE TESTS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Reverse engineer the hypothesis test plot from Lecture 20 to create accurate
hypothesis testing plots for each part of the previous question.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Question 4, part(a).
  \item Question 4, part(b).
